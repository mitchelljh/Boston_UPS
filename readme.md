## [UPS Facilities Locations and the Number of Households per Census Block Groups of Suffolk County](https://mitchelljh.github.io/Boston_UPS/) 

This interactive web map shows the UPS facilities as point data and the number of households as a choropleth map. Utilizing Leaflet, JavaScript (JS), CSS, and HTML code, this map combines these coding languages to create the finalized web map.

><i>During the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping and mailing has become an even greater need for those working and schooling from home. </i>

The point data shows how clustered and spread out the UPS facilities are compared to the household sizes.

Leaflet JS and CSS libraries, Leaflet Ajax JS library for the GeoJSON data, Chroma JS library for color schemes, Google Fonts CSS link, and a [Leaflet provider base map JS file](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) and linked JS script were all required for completing this map. Using functions to implement color, icon symbology, map elements, and GeoJSON styles were essential. JS coding language of loops and conditional statements were used to differentiate types of UPS facilities and associated colors, and for the Equal Interval classified household data.
